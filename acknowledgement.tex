The beauty of reaching a goal, besides discovering exciting things, is also based on the fact that a journey towards the goal often involves overcoming various hurdles. Here, I would like to acknowledge people that had helped along that journey and made reaching the goal possible.

I am very grateful to my co-promotor Erik Meijering and promotor Prof. Wiro Niessen for giving me the opportunity to do research job and for having enough patience and trust. The experience gained at Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam allowed me to discover the world better and shape up the views on work and life. It is important to emphasize involvement and supervision have directly helped as well as beautiful writing suggestions have made the manuscript prettier.

I would like to thank the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) for funding the project and all the reviewers for their constructive feedback.

I owe special gratitude to the colleagues and collaborators Ihor, Gadea, Carlos and Niels that helped building up this work and contributed to it. Many thanks to Petra and Desiree for the administrative support and to all past and present members of Medical Informatics and Radiology Department.

From the bottom of my heart, I wish to thank my parents Milija and Vera, my sister Danica and my girlfriend Letizia for all the kindness and support.
