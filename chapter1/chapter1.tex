\section{Neuron cell reconstruction} % 
\lettrine{F}{ascination} with the neuron cells dates to the pioneering investigation over a century ago when a glance into the sample of silver-stained brain tissue made it possible to disclose the intricate network that forms the very essence of the nervous system. Remarkable milestone drawings of Santiago Ram\'{o}n y Cajal \cite{ramon2008histologia} - the founding father of neuroscience, remain as vivid as the images acquired by the latest state-of-the-art fluorescence microscope. Ever since the breakthrough, numerous studies \cite{ascoli2001computer,defelipe2013new,defelipe2002microstructure,defelipe1992pyramidal,van2001need,scorcioni2004quantitative,mason2007initiation,gensel2010semi,markram2015reconstruction} have practiced using morphological features of the neurons to gain a deeper insight into various aspects of the functionality. Today seen as revolutionary, hundred years old hand-made illustrations depicting microscope-magnified samples of the brain tissue \cite{swanson2017} displayed exceptional level of detail. The insights comparable to the ones provided with the modern expert-assisted digital reconstructions obtained using the latest equipment, rendered with the newest computer graphics. For the years that came the discipline gradually established as neuroscience \cite{kandel2000principles}. Furthermore, the astounding advancement of electrical engineering and computer science laid out the foundations for more specialized disciplines such as neuroinformatics and neural engineering (Fig.~\ref{ch1_fig1}). Recently, the attention is directed towards brain science - domain dedicated to the investigation of the captivating mechanism of, arguably, one of the most complex and mysterious organs. The disclosure of Cajal's groundbreaking \textit{neuron doctrine}\footnote{Every neuron in the brain is separate. Neuron cells conduct information in a defined direction and communicate across the synapses \cite{glickstein2006golgi}.} brought to light the idea that the nervous system is a network composed of the building blocks called neuron cells. Each cell (Fig.~\ref{ch1_fig7}) further represents sophisticated, interconnected processing component that both transmit and process the information. Different cells have different roles and hence varying properties, including the topology. The network structure is very important and offers the possibility to grasp useful evidences related to the functionality.

Physical materialization of the cell portrays inner structure of the neuronal tissue and yields a valuable insight into the mechanisms behind the nervous system. Various studies have been carried out in order to understand neuron behavior and further unravel the underlying principles. Hence, the neuron morphology provides with an essential resource for specialized analysis that can typically include quantifying changes in neuronal structure caused by the external factors \cite{gomez2007immobilized,koppes2011neurite}, modeling \cite{ascoli2001computer}, classification \cite{armananzas2015towards} or the statistical analysis \cite{samsonovich2005statistical}. Widely used Sholl analysis methodology \cite{sholl1953dendritic} makes the direct use of the digital neuron reconstructions as blue print of the morphology. It is commonly used in neuroscientific experimentation for quantitative analysis of the morphological characteristics of the neuron \cite{garcia2014new}.

Neuron cell thus represents a core building block of the brain and the nervous system. It appears in variety of shapes (Figure~\ref{ch1_fig7}) and specializations \cite{ascolitrees}. The estimated number of neuron cells in a human brain amounts to striking 89 billion \cite{herculano2009human} - number comparable to the count of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. The dimension of each neuron can range from a few to several tens of micrometer with the neurite branch diameter typically measured in $\mu m$ scale. Each neuron is further connected to 50 thousand other neurons on average which results in an extremely powerful computational network and an very efficient information storage device. Intriguing mechanism of the brain functioning has recently emerged as an important research topic as the complex functionality of the brain defines much of the living organism activities, even the those abstract and subjective such as consciousness. Modeling the brain functionality is one of the grand unanswered questions of our era and central to diverse fields such as physics, mathematics, biology and recently prominent - computer science \cite{markram2015reconstruction}.

Numerous technical obstacles have nevertheless persisted when reaching out to record the neuronal sample. This is primarily due to the physical and physiological difficulties and the generally intangible functioning mode of the nervous system. With the early analogue computers \cite{glaser1965semi}, it became possible to connect computer with microscope and automate tracing using analogue linear motion transducers as well as significantly speed up gathering of the information about the dendritic and axonal patterns. Subsequent generations of digital computers \cite{capowski1981accurate,capowski1977computer} brought further advances in the neuron reconstruction technique by introducing the computer graphics mixed with the neuron image and the advanced operator controls such as 3D joystick. The expansion of home PC hardware and software in late decades of the 20th century increased the impact of the informatics. Breakthrough of the conventional PCs made it feasible to throughput more computation and eventually implement in practice the algorithms that, although previously discovered, could not be directly implemented and shared between the users on a needed scale. It also marks the period when the first commercial and open-source academic software solutions emerge and grow (Fig.~\ref{ch1_fig1}) which to this day proved to be a steady trend.

The crucial engineering tasks concerning the neuron reconstruction are: 1) need for the reduction of the time interval needed to compute the digital reconstruction and 2) most accurate possible reconstruction using often challenging data. The astonishing increase in the volume of acquired microscopy imaging data \cite{meijering2016imagining} undoubtedly raised the requirements bar when it comes to the time needed to for the reconstruction as images are increasingly larger and dedicated algorithms are needed to cope with the sized image volumes \cite{peng2017automatic}. Wide variety of neurons imaged under different modalities of the light microscopy (dark-field, bright-field, confocal) are still challenging for automated processing \cite{svoboda2011past,peng2011proof} and plethora of the reconstruction methods \cite{peng2011automatic} have ever since dealt with this task, resulting in two grand challenges such as DIADEM and BigNeuron \cite{peng2015diadem,peng2015bigneuron,gillette2011diademchallenge} (Fig.~\ref{ch1_fig1}) intended to encourage the community effort. As much as the field has advanced, both tasks are yet very actual.


The physical appearance of the neuron cells takes part in the nervous system activity. Morphology of the single cell, shape of the neuronal network, topology or connectivity react to the external conditions or external stimuli. With the imaging tools such as fluorescence microscopy, the physical appearance the morphology of the single cell can be captured at micro meter scale can be inspected and recorded. Indeed, the studies that require deeper analysis make use of the imaging techniques that can reach nano meter scale, such as electron microscopy. In other words, accurate quantification of the cell shape is an important step towards better understanding of the cell functionality. Quantification of the neuronal structure is crucial in many neuroscience studies \cite{halavi2012digital} and quantification from microscopic images is identified as one of the major technical challenges in the digital era of neuroscience \cite{peng2015diadem}.

The advancements in informatics made it possible (Fig.~\ref{ch1_fig1}) to utilize computers to solve the neuroinformatics challenges over recent decades. With the ever growing amount of data, the processing of the information remains a challenge.

\section{Essential obstacles in neuron morphology reconstruction}
The key obstacles concerning the full, accurate and robust automation of the neuron reconstruction \cite{meijering2010neuron,donohue2011automated,acciai2016automated} can be seen through the number of hampering factors that concern both the nature of the data and the imaging modality. In this regard, it is possible to point out a list of hurdling items.

\textit{Diverse morphology} the structural ambiguities of the diverse neuron cells (Fig.~\ref{ch1_fig7}) often intractable to the human visual comprehension.

\textit{Noise} noisy image input (imaging on the boundary of the resolution limits in case of the light microscopy). Perticles and debris erroneously detected as neuron structures.

\textit{Data size} ever increasing size of the image volume needed to be correctly processed in reasonable time. Although the processing of the 3D data (image stacks) is a  Processing of the stitched images.

\textit{Need for customization} The algorithms often need to be tailored in order to address a particular biological question and be used in wider range of the biological questions being studied which prevents them from being used across different laboratories.

\textit{Standardization} The gold standard annotations can differ between different experts.

\textit{Dynamic images} Analysis of the images captured from the live neuronal cultures.


Aforementioned factors impose much of the computational barrier \cite{peng2011proof,svoboda2011past} in attempt to consistently produce human-comparable digital reconstructions. The real datasets, therefore, commonly leave with the persisting need for human expert assistance to obtain the optimal output. 

\section{Neuron tracing in light microscopy images}
Neuron reconstruction tools have been adopting to the advancements of technical infrastructure available for experimentation. In decades following the emergence of neuroscience, the instrumentation has been a limiting factor to the amount and the variety of the morphologic data that could be gathered \ref{ch1__fig1}. At the beginning of the second half of the 20th century, conventional electronic analog techniques were used to join microscope and the analogue computer to automate the neuron morphology quantification \cite{glaser1965semi},  \cite{capowski1981accurate}. Variety of sowrtware platforms \cite{meijering2010neuron,acciai2016automated}. One of the key Java tools is the ImageJ library \cite{abramoff2004image} with method \cite{longair2011simple,pool2008neuritetracer}.

\section{Neuronal reconstruction format}
Once processed, neurons are typically exported into a dedicated data format intended to store the idiosyncratic tree-like topology of the cell. Among different ideas and implementations of standards used for storing reconstructed neurons, two neuron morphology file formats prevail in lab usage and recent large scale neuron related projects \cite{bakker2016web}: Neurolucida DAT format (MicroBrightField, Inc.) and SWC format \cite{cannon1998line}. Neurolucida DAT format is closed-source binary format whose reverse engineered description\footnote{http://neuronland.org} suggests neuron compartments being saved as a hierarchical tree of the linear segments. SWC format on the other hand is open-source, space delimited text format that stores tree structure in an array $\mathcal{N} = \{ n_1, \dots , n_i, \dots , n_j, \dots  \}$ where each element of an array $n_i$ corresponds to a neuronal compartment (Fig.~\ref{}). SWC, hence, describes a reconstruction as a list of 3D nodes (neuronal compartments) with seven attributes (NeuroMorpho.org):  $i$: node index identifier, node type $[0-7]$, node 3D coordinates $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$, radius $(r_i)$ and a parent node index - link towards the predecessor parent node $(j | j=-1)$ if the node has no parent soma node, Fig.~\ref{ch1_fig5}. To define a correct tree structure, each node can only have one predecessor (parent) and the parent node should have lower index so that the indexes of the reconstruction are sorted. Loops and disconnected branches should not exist. The originating node has parend  Etymologically, SWC represents the acronym containing the initials of the last names of Stockley, Wheal, and Cole. Although not directly described in their joint work on quantitative measurement and modeling of the neuron morphology \cite{stockley1993system}, the origin of the SWC name is an acronym of the initials of their last names. 

Lastly, there is slight uncertainty on the SWC format, especially concerning the unified definition on how soma reconstruction is addressed \cite{bakker2016web}, resulting in several variations over the SWC standard \footnote{http://research.mssm.edu/cnic/swc.html}\footnote{http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html}. The work showcased in this thesis will exclusively use open source SWC format.
