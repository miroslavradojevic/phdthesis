\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Detecting junctions and terminations of the neuron tree image are complementary outcomes of the same nonlinear decision (\emph{Chapter 2 of this thesis}).

\medskip
  
\item Bayesian multi-object tracking helps separating closely running neuron fibers (\emph{Chapter 3 of this thesis}).  
% allows convenient handling of bifurcations and terminations during the tracing process by modeling of spawned objects and observation clutter  
\medskip

\item Tracing the image structures repeatedly and in a statistically independently way, yields more evidence about the underlying neuron branches and leads to better reconstructions (\emph{Chapter 4 of this thesis}).
	
\medskip

\item Synthetic neuron images represent useful alternatives to the real imagery for objective evaluation of neuron reconstruction algorithms (\emph{Chapter 4 of this thesis}).
% for the evaluation process
% Bayesian filtering can be successfully adjusted to neuron reconstruction task and provide with state-of-the art precise traces
\medskip

\item The high-resolution scan time and analysis of the neuron culture in high-throughput screening can be drastically reduced by using machine learning approaches (\emph{Chapter 5 of this thesis}).
%Machine learning approaches are able to produce adequate initial detection of the sections containing neuron morphology in high-throughput screening mosaics which can drastically reduce the high-resolution scan time and analysis 

\medskip
\item Neuron reconstruction gold standard is a never absolutely accurate. Obtaining manual annotation is inevitably subject to a plausible degree of subjectivity which implies the evaluations are, also, never absolutely accurate.
% of an unverifiable existence
%Acquiring high quality gold standard expert reconstructions of intricate neuron microscopic images is vital for the accurate evaluation of the image analysis algorithms.

\medskip 

\item Computer algorithms are irreplaceable tools for processing the ever growing neuronal image data. 

\medskip
  
\item Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability (\emph{Edsger Dijkstra}).

\medskip

\item As complexity rises, precise statements lose meaning and meaningful statements lose precision (\emph{Lotfi A. Zadeh}).

\medskip

\item Any man could, if he were so inclined, be the sculptor of his own brain (\emph{Santiago Ram\'{o}n y Cajal}, \emph{Advice for a Young Investigator}, \oldstylenums{1897}).

\medskip

\item The plan is O.K. Only that, for some reason, the events do not stick to it (\emph{Borislav Peki\'{c}}, \emph{Rabies}, \oldstylenums{1983}).
